                            <li>Cloud Computing -<span class="answer">  Cloud computing behaves much like the client/server model of Figure 7.24 in that there are server nodes that provide services and client nodes that access those services. However, with cloud computing the servers no longer need to be local to the client population, and they no longer must be provided by your own organization.</span></li>
                            <li>Net Neutrality -<span class="answer"> means that a public information network such as an Internet service provider (ISP) should treat all users, all platforms, and all  content equally—essentially it should be operated like the water, electric, and gas companies, as publicly ­regulated utilities.</span></li>
