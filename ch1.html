                                    next operation. Sequential operations are usually expressed as simple
                                    declarative sentences.</span></li>

                                    an algorithm. They ask a question, and the next operation is then selected

                                    the bulky vacuum tube was replaced by a single transistor only a few millimeters in size, and memory was now constructed using tiny magnetic cores
                                    only 1/50th of an inch in diameter. </span></li>

                                    point that a complete computer system could be contained on a single circuit
                                    board that you could hold in your hand.</span></li>

                                    changing so fast that the concept of distinct generations of computer development has outlived its usefulness. In computer science, change is now a
                                    constant companion. </span></li>
