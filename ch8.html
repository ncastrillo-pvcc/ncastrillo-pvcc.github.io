                                <li>Information Security - <span class="answer">protecting data from those who do not have permission to access it.</span></li>
                                <li>Authentication - <span class="answer">the process of verifying that you really are the person who has the right to access a particular device, whether it is your local machine or the remote server.</span></li>
                                <li>Authorization - <span class="answer">governs what an authenticated user is allowed to do.</span></li>
                                <li>Dual Authentication - <span class="answer">Some company networks use a dual authentication scheme that works as follows: The legitimate user enters his or her user ID and password. <br>Each user has a small device (or perhaps a smartphone app) that then generates a random sequence of digits, which is good only for a few seconds, that the user must enter. <br>Some websites present the user with an image of text written with distorted letters and the user then has to type the correct text into a textbox on the webpage.</span></li>
                                <li>Social Engineering - <span class="answer">the process of using people to get the information you want.</span></li>
                                <li>Virus - <span class="answer">a computer program that, like a biological virus, infects a host computer and then spreads. It embeds itself within another program or file.</span></li>
                                <li>Worm - <span class="answer">similar to a virus, but it can send copies of itself to other nodes on a computer network without having to be carried by an infected host file.</span></li>
                                <li>Trojan - <span class="answer">a computer program that does some legitimate computational task but also, unbeknownst to the user, contains code to perform the same kinds of malicious attacks as viruses and worms—corrupt or delete files, slow down the computer, and the like.</span></li>
                                <li>Ransomeware - <span class="answer">invades the user’s computer, often by means of an infected email attachment. It then encrypts files on that computer, usually with a strong enough encryption algorithm that only the author of the malware software, who holds the decryption key, can unlock the files.</span></li>
                                <li>Phishing - <span class="answer">a practice used to illegally obtain sensitive information such as credit card numbers, account numbers, and passwords.</li>
                                <li>White Hat - <span class="answer">are the security experts who try to keep us safe in cyberspace.</span></li>
                                <li>Black Hat - <span class="answer">are the bad guys (or gals!) who try to ferret out computer system weaknesses for financial gain, control, or outright destruction.</span></li>
                                <li>Encryption/Decryption - <span class="answer">encryption is the process of using an algorithm to convert information into a representation that cannot be understood or utilized by anyone without the appropriate decryption algorithm. <br>Decryption is the reverse of encryption, using an algorithm that converts the ciphertext back into plain text.</span></li>
                                <li>Cryptography - <span class="answer">is the science of “secret writing.” A message (plaintext) is encoded (encrypted) before it is sent, for the purpose of keeping its content secret if it is intercepted by the wrong parties.</span></li>
                                <li>Symmetric Encryption Algorithm - <span class="answer">a symmetric encryption algorithm requires the use of a secret key known to both the sender and the receiver.</span></li>
                                <li>Caesar Cipher - <span class="answer">also called a shift cipher, involves shifting each character in the message to another character some fixed distance farther along in the alphabet.</span></li>
                                <li>Block Cipher - <span class="answer">a group or block of plaintext letters gets encoded into a block of ciphertext, but not by substituting one character at a time for each letter.</span></li>
                                <li>Data Encryption Standard (DES) - <span class="answer">DES was designed to protect electronic information, so the plaintext is a binary string of 0s and 1s, just as it is stored in a computer. As we learned in Chapter 4, this means that ordinary text has already undergone an encoding using ASCII or Unicode to convert characters to bit strings.</span></li>
                                <li>Public Key System - <span class="answer">In a public key system, the encryption key for messages to go to a particular receiver is broadcast to everyone, but the decryption key cannot be derived from it and is known only by the receiver.</span></li>
                                <li>Embedded Computers - <span class="answer">Embedded computers are computational devices such as chips, processors, or computers that are embedded within another system.</span></li>

                        <br><br>For example, if the first letter of the text file to be hidden is “A”, with
                        ASCII code 01000001, then the first 8 bytes of the image file would be modified
                        (if needed) so that the least significant bits are 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, and 1. To the

                        <li> - <span class="answer">Be sure your computer has up-to-date antivirus software from a reputable company. Such software can detect worms, viruses, and Trojan horses by the distinctive “signatures” those programs carry. It cleans your machine of infected files</span></li>
                        <li> - <span class="answer">Be sure your computer has up-to-date firewall software from a reputable company. Firewall software guards the access points to your computer, blocking communications to or from sites you don’t permit and preventing certain operations from being initiated across the Internet.</span></li>
                        <li> - <span class="answer">Be sure your computer has up-to-date antispyware from a reputable company.
