                            <li>RAM: <span class="answer">It is s a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.</span></li>
                            <li>Cache:<span class="answer"> To exploit this observation, the first time that the computer references a piece of data, it should copy that data from regular RAM memory to a special, high-speed memory unit called cache memory.</span> </li>
                            <li>Principle of locality: The high likelihood that when a program fetches a piece of data or an instruction:</li>

                                <li><span class="answer">It will access that same instruction or piece of data in the very near future.</span></li>
                                <li><span class="answer">It will soon access the instructions or data that are located near that piece of data, where “near” means an address whose numerical value is close to this one.</span></li>

                            <li>ROM: <span class="answer">A special type of random access memory into which information has been prerecorded during manufacture. This infor- mation cannot be modified or removed, only fetched. ROM is used to hold important system instructions and data in a place where a user cannot acci- dentally or intentionally overwrite them.</span></li>
                            <li>Memory cell size:<span class="answer">The number of bits per cell is called the cell size or the memory width, and it is usually denoted as W.</span></li>
                            <li>Memory Cell Address:<span class="answer">Each memory cell in RAM is identified by a unique unsigned integer address 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .</span></li>
                            <li>Maximum Memory Size:<span class="answer">The value 2N is called the address space or maximum memory size of the computer.</span></li>
                            <li>Register:<span class="answer">contains the data value being fetched or stored.</span></li>
                            <li>Fetch:<span class="answer"> Fetch a copy of the contents of the memory cell with the specified address and return those contents as the result of the operation. The original contents of the memory cell that was accessed are unchanged</span></li>
                            <li>Store:<span class="answer"></span>Store the specified value into the memory cell specified by address. The previous contents of the cell are lost. This is termed a destructive store.</li>
                            <li>Memory Access Time:<span class="answer">One of the characteristics of random access memory is that the time to carry out either a fetch or a store operation is the same for all 2N addresses. At current levels of technology, this time, called the memory access time, is typically about 5–10 nanoseconds (nanosecond = 1 nsec = 10−9 seconds = 1 billionth of a second).</span></li>
                            <li>DASD:<span class="answer">A direct access storage device (DASD) is one in which, it takes the same amount of time to access every cel, and equal access time, has been eliminated.</span></li>
                            <li>Arithmetic And Logic Unit (ALU):<span class="answer">The arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) is the subsystem that performs such mathematical and logical operations as addition, subtraction, and comparison for equality.</span></li>
                            <li>Control Unit<span class="answer">The most fundamental characteristic of the Von Neumann architecture is the stored program—a sequence of machine language instructions stored as binary values in memory.</span></li>
